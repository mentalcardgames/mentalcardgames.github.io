# Student Milestones

This lists the active milestones and software engineering packages available for
student projects.
Each milestone represents a core challenge within our architecture.
Rather than being tied to rigid academic ECTS levels,
tasks are dynamically scaled and adjusted based on a student's expected
workload.

## Engine Extraction & Generalization

::: danger

TODO: not finalized

Anpassen an [Concurrent Execution Environment](#concurrent-execution-environment)

:::

Coupling game rules directly with system logic limits modularity and prevents
rule reuse.
To support a generic framework, the game engine must be isolated from the
application's infrastructure, allowing it to evaluate rules independent.

### Game Engine Crate Extraction

**The Problem:**

The current state machine logic for static Poker is tightly coupled with
frontend rendering and backend connection supervisors, causing it to be active
at all times.

**Motivation:**

We would like to have the poker implementation decoupled and controllable.
This way it can be run only when needed and it allows us to compare a dynamic
implementation of poker in CGDL.

**Deliverables:**

- Extract all Poker-specific states, rules, and game FSM code into a dedicated
workspace crate (e.g., `crates/static_poker` or `crates/static/poker`).
- Define a clean, uniform interface/traits that the main application can call to
step through states.
- Ensure the existing Poker game remains fully playable using the new decoupled
boundaries.

## UI Rendering

Card games vary wildly in their rules, spatial layouts, hidden information, and
card interactions.
To support arbitrary games, the rendering layer must dynamically adapt to
different game states rather than relying on hardcoded heuristics or assumptions
about a single game's structure.

### Text-based User Interface (TUI) Frontend

**The Problem:**

Directly implementing an interface capable of rendering any arbitrary card game
is extremely difficult, as they vary wildly in rules, spatial layouts,
hidden information, and card interactions.
Additionally, our current frontend is hardcoded specifically for the static
Poker game, making it impossible to render other games.

**Motivation:**

A Text-based User Interface (TUI) bypasses layout and visual styling
complexities by rendering structured text or ASCII grids.
Following our **split-node thin-client** model, the TUI operates as a standalone
View client that connects to the native backend's Controller via WebSockets,
receiving state projections and sending user actions as standard message
packets.
This serves as a first stepping stone to test and verify the CGDL engine's
capabilities before building a full GUI.

**Deliverables:**

- Implement a terminal-based frontend View binary either as part of the
`mcg-cli` binary or as a standalone crate.
- Connect to the native backend controller using the WebSocket messaging
protocol (`Frontend2BackendMsg` / `Backend2FrontendMsg`).
- Determine all components from CGDL that need representation.
- Provide implementations of
[`std::fmt::Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html)
or a custom trait for all representable components.
- Provide an interactive prompt allowing the user to select which parts of the
received state projection to print or track in real time.
- Support shortcuts or commands to quickly display specific zones, variables,
or parts of the game state.
- Implement a "watchlist" mechanism to pin chosen components, keeping them
permanently visible and auto-updating them on the screen when the state changes.

### Providing more widgets

**The Problem:**

The frontend crate currently implements only basic card and field rendering
primitives (e.g., `SimpleField`).
They are insufficient for rendering all components found in card games, such as
grids, multiplayer tables, and additional player attributes.
Furthermore, they lack generic interfaces for advanced interactions like
multi-selection and drag-and-drop between arbitrary fields.

**Motivation:**

Developing a library of reusable, rule-agnostic UI widgets ensures they can be
composed to represent diverse game zones and layouts independently of any
concrete game rules.
Developing these widgets independently ensures they are thoroughly tested,
modularized, and interactive, setting up a solid foundation for the renderer to
easily translate CGDL files into interactive interfaces.

**Deliverables:**

- Expand the widget library in the `frontend` crate to support components from
CGDL.
- Make parameters configurable (e.g., spacing, overlap offset, rotation,
card size, margins).
- Standardize interaction states (e.g., drag-and-drop source/destination tags,
single/multi-selection modes, hover preview/zoom).
- Decouple widgets from concrete game state types so they only rely on generic
traits.
- Provide a widget catalog or demonstration screen in the game client
showcasing all layout widgets and their configurations.

### Extending CGDL with Markup

**The Problem:**

There is an immense variety of card games, and almost every game layout is
unique.
When comparing two different card games, it is nearly guaranteed that they
place, arrange, and move cards across the table in distinct ways
(e.g., community cards in the center, hands held privately, discard piles,
or separate trick-taking zones).
Trying to support infinitely many game layouts without an explicit
markup language would force the rendering system to rely on complex layout
heuristics, which is fragile and difficult to scale.

**Motivation:**

In the physical world, card game rulebooks not only explain the rules but also
specify where the deck, discard piles, and players' hands are physically located
on the table.
We can apply this exact analogy to mental card games.
Since we already have a Card Game Description Language (CGDL) to describe the
rules, we can extend it with markup capabilities that describe the layout and
placement of elements.

**Deliverables:**

- Design the syntax and semantics of the CGDL language extension for spatial
markup definitions.
- Implement parser support for the new layout markup within the existing
CGDL parser.
- Ensure the layout extension integrates seamlessly with the existing CGDL and
game engine.

## Tooling & Developer Experience

Developing custom game descriptions and debugging distributed peer-to-peer state
mutations is difficult and slow without visibility.
High-quality tooling and editor integrations are required to inspect runtime
behaviors and validate rules during development.

### State Mutation & Network Control

**The Problem:**

There are currently no developer tools to observe or control the project's
behavior at runtime.
Debugging peer-to-peer state mutations and component interactions is tedious and
slow, as developers must write custom manual tests to simulate edge cases and
cannot inspect or alter state dynamically.

**Motivation:**

We need a flexible developer playground to debug the native node.
By exposing dedicated debugging endpoints on the backend **Controller**,
developers can query and manipulate game state, craft custom protocol messages,
and control peer connections at runtime to test algorithms and verify execution
flows on the fly.

**Deliverables:**

- Extend the TUI console to act as a debug View client connecting to the
Controller's administrative interface.
- Expose debug endpoints on the Controller to allow safe inspection and mutation
of the underlying Model (game state) at runtime.
- Support crafting and injecting test protocol messages directly into the
Controller's P2P network processing pipeline.
- Expose connection management commands (initiate, disconnect, block) to
simulate network disruptions and P2P topologies.

### CGDL Language Server Protocol (LSP)

**The Problem:**

Developers writing card game descriptions currently lack the full extent of
modern tooling provided by an LSP.
This makes writing CGDL error-prone and frustrating.

**Motivation:**

The goal is to establish a rich developer experience for writing CGDL.
Implementing a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server provides real-time
diagnostics, autocompletion, and tooltips directly inside the developer's
editor, making CGDL self-documenting and safe to write.

**Deliverables:**

- Research and document all standard capabilities specified in the
Language Server Protocol (LSP) specification.
- Formulate a design strategy explaining how those capabilities will be utilized
in the context of CGDL.
- Audit and document existing features in the LSP codebase.
- Establish a prioritized implementation roadmap, ranking features
(e.g., autocomplete, hover tooltips) based on their importance to CGDL
usage scenarios.
- Implement the prioritized LSP capabilities in the language server backend
(`lsp_server` crate) using the CGDL parser.
- Build and package a VS Code extension that bundles and launches the Rust LSP
executable.

## Cryptography & Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

To support serverless card games, our project relies on distributed trust.
Instead of relying on a trusted central authority or server to deal cards and
maintain state secrets, we use cryptographic primitives and
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).
This ensures that players can hide their private hands, perform verifiable 
operations (such as shuffling or drawing), and prove their compliance with game
rules without revealing any sensitive information.

### Implementing the Toolbox

**The Problem:**

To play card games over a decentralized network without a trusted third party,
players must be able to perform card operations
(such as shuffling, dealing, drawing, and verification) securely.
Currently, our application lacks the core cryptographic primitives needed to
hide card values from players while keeping the game state verifiable and
preventing cheating or collusion.

**Motivation:**

We want to build a general-purpose application capable of playing arbitrary
card games.
To achieve this, we need a toolbox of primitives as defined in
Christian Schindelhauer's paper *A Toolbox for Mental Card Games* (1998)
(referenced in [Literature & References](../organisational/literature.md#foundational-literature)).
Implementing these primitives allows players to hide card information while
maintaining a shared, secure game state.
This can be done either by writing them from scratch in Rust, or by wrapping an
already implemented C/C++ version
(such as the [libtmcg library](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libtmcg/))
inside a Rust crate.
Alternatively, it's possible to implement the improved primitives described by
Heiko Stamer in
[Efficient Electronic Gambling: An Extended Implementation of the Toolbox for Mental Card Games](../organisational/literature.md#foundational-literature).

**Deliverables:**

- Research the foundational primitives described in
*A Toolbox for Mental Card Games* (1998)
and the improved implementations in
*Efficient Electronic Gambling* (2005).
- Provide the implementation either as a native Rust crate written from scratch,
or as a Rust FFI/wrapper around an existing C/C++ implementation like `libtmcg`.
- Expose a clean, idiomatic Rust API that allows for verifiable deck and
card operations.

### Interface for Cryptography

**The Problem:**

Different cryptographic protocols (e.g., ElGamal vs. Lattice Codes) and
implementations offer varying trade-offs in performance, security, and
proof sizes.
Without a unified interface, integrating a specific cryptographic implementation
directly into the project couples the specific logic with that
cryptography library.
This makes studying, benchmarking, or swapping implementations tedious and
error-prone, as it requires modifying the entire integration layer of the
application.

**Motivation:**

By introducing an abstract interface (a set of Rust traits), we decouple the
cryptographic implementation from the engine and networking layers.
Placing this interface in a shared core library allows both the WebAssembly View
(frontend) and the native Controller (backend) to use, serialize, and
deserialize cryptographic objects cleanly.

**Deliverables:**

- Define a set of Rust traits (e.g., in a `mcg-crypto` crate) representing core
mental card game primitives, including key setup, card masking/unmasking,
verifiable shuffles, and ZKP generation/verification.
- Adapt existing implementations to conform to this new unified interface.
- Provide a mock implementation of the traits, which is insecure, to simplify
integration testing and speed up development of other components.

### Protocol Integration

**The Problem:**

In a peer-to-peer system, players broadcast their actions along with
cryptographic proofs to verify that game rules are followed without revealing
private card details.
However, our application currently lacks any protocol integration between the
game engine and the cryptography layer.
Hardcoding cryptographic verification directly inside the game engine's
state machine violates separation of concerns.
We need a modular architecture that separates pure card game logic from the
network-level cryptographic verification and proof-generation.

**Motivation:**

To maintain a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, the cryptography
layer is implemented as an independent component within our actor model.
The Controller acts as the central orchestrator:
incoming network messages are first intercepted and forwarded to the Crypto
Actor for validation.
The message is only applied to the game engine (the Model) if its ZKP is valid.
Conversely, when a local player mutates their state, the Controller prompts the
Crypto Actor to generate a corresponding ZKP, which is then broadcasted to other
peers.
This prevents code duplication, simplifies testing, and keeps the game engine
decoupled from cryptographic protocol details.

**Deliverables:**

- Implement a dedicated **Crypto Actor** responsible for key management,
card encryption/masking state, and ZKP generation/verification.
- Integrate the verification flow into the MVC Controller:
intercept incoming network messages, request validation from the Crypto Actor,
and forward the message to the game engine only upon successful verification.
- Implement the local action flow:
mutate the local engine state, instruct the Crypto Actor to generate the
necessary ZKP for the mutation, and broadcast the action and proof to the peer
network.

- Provide an API allowing individual screens to register callbacks for specific message types.
- Decouple screen rendering entirely from connection lifecycle states.

### Actor-Inspired Backend Messaging Architecture
