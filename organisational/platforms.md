# Info

Information and data on mental card games is spread across a few different
places.

# Platforms

## Cone

 [Cone](https://cone.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/tea/projects-and-theses-2025)
is the place for official information and announcements and unlike this site,
is an official part of the ALU Freiburg.

## Element

Matrix Channel on the Uni-Freiburg
[Matrix Server](https://ilias.uni-freiburg.de/matrix-support).
Contact Schindelhauer to be added.

## GitHub

https://github.com/mentalcardgames

It'd be cool if your MCG related code could be moved into this org so everyone
can roughly see what is happening within the project.

Please write to paperbenni@gmail.com if you want to be added as a GitHub
organization member.

## NextCloud

https://nc.informatik.uni-freiburg.de

## Other GitHub Repos

As of now code is spread across multiple Repos under multiple accounts as of now. Moving
these to this GitHub repo would be nice, and since we're not currently aiming
for a microservice architecture, ideally at some point all code uses the same
tech stack and lives in the same repo.

## Known external repos

- https://github.com/gSys1337/mcg_visual
- https://github.com/gSys1337/mcg_visual_wasm_template

::: tip
If you are in posession of or know of a repo containing MCG related code, either
add it here or move it to the [GitHub org](https://github.com/mentalcardgames).
